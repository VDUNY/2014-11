# Bootstrap #

Twitter Bootstrap aims to create a common ***design language*** for developing websites. Almost all sites have the same basic elements:

- Navigation elements
- Grid system for layout
- Buttons
- Panels
- Alerts (success, error, warning, etc.)

By using this common ***design language***, developers can focus on the code that enables the website to function without worrying about how to make it look good. The designers can style the common design elements to make the site unique and match your brand. Once that is complete, all that you need to do is swap out the stylesheet!

This topic will focus on:

- What is Bootstrap?
- Grid System & Media Queries
- Common elements
- Advanced elements
- Themes using LESS
